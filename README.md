# discord.js-small
discord.js but just smaller (uses less resources and efficently allows the use of 2 bots at once :)
(this is a fork of discord.js v13-14 modified to be more resource free)
INSTALLING THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED NOT STABLE THIS IS SIMPLY MY OWN ATTEMPT OF MAKING DISCORD.JS SMALLER I WILL NOT PROVIDE TUTORIAL ON HOW TO USE IT AND NEITHER DO I RECOMMENDED RUNNING /INSTALLING THIS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
